            <AccordionContent className="dark:text-gray-300">
              Creating a list is simple! Click the "+" button to add new items. You can drag and drop items to reorder them, mark them as complete with a checkbox, and delete items using the trash icon. Lists can be categorized and customized with different titles and settings.

            <AccordionContent className="dark:text-gray-300">
              The lock feature prevents accidental changes to your list. When locked, you can't add, delete, or reorder items, but you can still mark items as complete. This is particularly useful when sharing lists with others or when you want to preserve a specific order.

            <AccordionContent className="dark:text-gray-300">
              The pricing feature allows you to add costs to list items. Toggle it on using the price switch, then enter prices for each item. The total is automatically calculated and displayed at the bottom of your list. You can also customize the currency symbol.

              Yes! You can share lists via email or generate a shareable link. You can also export lists as PDF files for easy sharing or printing. Consider locking the list before sharing to prevent unwanted changes.
